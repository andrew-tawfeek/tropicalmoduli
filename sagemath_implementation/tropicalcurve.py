# This file is dedicated to crafting a dedicated class for Tropical Curves.
# Reference: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/blob/develop/src/sage/quivers/representation.py
# This formatting is modeled after the implementation of quivers (from representation theory) in Sage.
# Actually... also, perhaps more relevant... https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/thematic_tutorials/sandpile.html



# Other important items to implement:
# Contraction of an edge
# Outputing (todo: find right type of data structure) associated singular surface (and .obj/LaTeX potentially?)
