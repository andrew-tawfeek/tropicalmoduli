which layer of m_g,n is the widest one? (math result? matroid top-heavy? check m_g,n geometry of varieties)


current desired algoirthms:
sorting algorithms: as we generate each level, sort them so the isomorphism check has to check less things (i.e. we want clever isomorphism checks)
top down algoriithms
combing top-down and bottom-up



before automorphism check:
- check vertex counts
- check edge counts
- bite the bullet: call the function
 

adopt in pickling in python

add into current algorithms: keep count running of how many times isomorphism-check is being called
