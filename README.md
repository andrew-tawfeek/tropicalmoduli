# Tropical Moduli Project
This repository is dedicated to computing the cells/graphs within the moduli space of tropical curves $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}^\text{trop}$. 

This research project is being run by the participants of the University of Washington's [Tropical Geometry Seminar](https://www.atawfeek.com/moduli).

## Current Goals:
- [ ] Compute the $f$-vector of the poset being output by the current implementation of $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}^\text{trop}$ and check against Theorem 2.12 of Melody's paper[^5]
- [ ] Can we implement a dynamic-approach to the computation, using the observation that $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}^\text{trop}$ admits a stratification by lower moduli $g$ and $n$? (Also, can we find an explicit source for this as a mathematical statement? Maybe in this[^6]?)
- [ ] Implement top-down approach to computation (e.g. by generating all maximal first, then contracting).
- [ ] Write-in a SageMath to/from Python translation (particularly cleanly between `networkx` and `graphs` for tropical curves) to expand compatibility between platforms (and to assist with later work, e.g. matroids...).
- [ ] Look into UW mathematics department/general usage computing cluster usage for large-scale computation of poset to store for future-use/offer publicly.
- [ ] Continue research into what aspects of the package are worthwhile developing based on most-recent publications (e.g. cohomology direction of cone complexes? etc. -- find and compile sources).

## Future Questions/Directions:
- Using Sage's **convex rational polyhedral cone** package (paired with **toric plotter**) we could potentially display $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}^\text{trop}$ as a generalized cone complex and have this interplay nicely with the poset of dual grpahs.
- Can we extend the code to interact well with the matroid perspective[^4] of tropical geometry, perhaps with the aid of Sage's already well-developed **matroid package**?
- Following up on the cone complexes: we should then be able to compute the _link_ $\Delta_{g,n}$ of the cone complex -- potentially paving the way towards cohomology[^3]...
- **(Hard)** What can we do towards extending our work to compactifications of other moduli spaces, such as K3 surfaces?[^1][^2]
