# Tropical Moduli Project
This repository is dedicated to computing the cells/graphs within the moduli space of tropical curves $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}^\text{trop}$. 

This research project is being run by the participants of the University of Washington's [Tropical Geometry Seminar](https://www.atawfeek.com/moduli).

## Questions/Directions:
- Using Sage's **convex rational polyhedral cone** package (paired with **toric plotter**) we could potentially display $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}^\text{trop}$ as a generalized cone complex and have this interplay nicely with the poset of dual grpahs.
- Following up on the above: assuming an implementation of the above, we should then be able to compute the _link_ $\Delta_{g,n}$ of the cone complex -- potentially paving the way towards cohomology[^3]...
- Can we extend the code to interact well with the matroid perspective[^4] of tropical geometry, perhaps with the aid of Sage's already well-developed **matroid package**?
- **(Hard)** What can we do towards extending our work to compactifications of other moduli spaces, such as K3 surfaces?[^1][^2]
