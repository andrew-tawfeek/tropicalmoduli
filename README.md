# tropicalmoduli
This repository is dedicated to computing the cells/graphs within the moduli space of tropical curves $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}^\text{trop}$. 

This research project is being run by the participants of the University of Washington's [Tropical Geometry Seminar](https://www.atawfeek.com/moduli).
