# Tropical Moduli Project
This repository is dedicated to computing the cells/graphs within the moduli space of tropical curves $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}^\text{trop}$. 

This research project is being run by the participants of the University of Washington's [Tropical Geometry Seminar](https://www.atawfeek.com/moduli).

## Questions/Directions:
- Using Sage's [convex rational polyhedral cone](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/discrete_geometry/sage/geometry/cone.html#sage.geometry.cone.Cone) package (paired with [toric plotter](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/discrete_geometry/sage/geometry/toric_plotter.html)) we could potentially display $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}^\text{trop}$ as a generalized cone complex and have this interplay nicely with the poset of dual grpahs.
- Following up on the above: assuming an implementation of the above, we should then be able to compute the _link_ $\Delta_{g,n}$ of the cone complex -- potentially paving the way [towards cohomology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.10186)...
- Can we extend the code to interact well with the [matroid perspective](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/201808/rnoti-p902.pdf) of tropical geometry, perhaps with the aid of Sage's already well-developed [matroid package](https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/reference/matroids/index.html)?
